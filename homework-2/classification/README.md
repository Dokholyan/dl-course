# Classification task

Hi! This part of the homework is focused on classification task.
You will code a model to classify objects.
To get maximum score, your model should have `0.85` accuracy on the test part of dataset.
Remember, that Kaggle competitions have **public** and **private** parts of test dataset. 
So, final score will be considered on metrics of both parts.

To train you model, you should use GPU. We recommend to use `Kaggle Notebooks`. 


## Rules
- Don't use `torchvision` or any pretrained models. Model weights must be initialized randomly
- Model code must be presented on one notebook(w/o separated `.py` files)
- Don't cheat! If your submission results are anomaly higher than your notebook model results, you will have **0 points**
- Don't plagiarize! If we find two or more notebooks with a similar code, all involved students will have **0 points**
